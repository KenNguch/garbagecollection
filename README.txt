--------------ABOUT THE PROJECT----------
This is an online truck ticket/booking system.With this system truck company owners can easily manage the bookings/reservations for slots in their trucks.Company owners can manage truck routes,truck availability and list all the trucks and slots.With this system customers cannot book for slots that have already been booked.Customers can not also do double reservation for eaxample if a customer has booked slot A10,DATE:today truck:1 The same customer cannot also go and book slot A20:DATE:today truck:1 same departure time.
Customers can only make reservations for trucks and routes that are made available by admin or company management.This is to avoid confusions and enable proper planning and descition making.
The system admin can view summary reports of all and or fundamental activities within the system and be able to tell how the system is working from the rich insights from the summaries.
Customers can print receipts upon successfull booking and or can go to the booking agent to print the receipt and confirm payment.
